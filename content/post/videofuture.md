*"What is this about?" And "You can’t automate creative work!"*

There was always a task I absolutely hated as a designer - creating social media visuals. 
When you get a new project or new season starts with a lot of positive energy, promising all new ways and it starts your creative juices flowing. 
Picturing the story, making the taglines and looking for pictures. Idyllic!

It sounds super fun and creative. But in reality is means implementing it multiple times over for several countries, adding text to creative assets 
each time and multiple advertising channels. And that can mean hundreds of ads. Multiple days of working. And I’m talking about static ads at this 
point. Not even video.

Video is eating the world. That is a fact now. Creating dozens of video ads takes an order of magnitude more effort. 

Can you imagine creating all this and then our marketing people would try to match them to the right target group only for Facebook to say it’s 
exhausted after a day? Then you’re back to the drawing board.

Creating Christmas ads can be so much fun. But the whole period is lasting multiple weeks. 
It’s impossible one set of ads would make you last so long!

Digital ad revenue grew to $72.5 billion in 2016, up 22% from the year before. That’s according to the latest Internet Advertising Revenue 
Report from PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (a trade group for online publishers and advertisers).

The report also says that for the first time, mobile ads accounted for more than half of that spending — $36.6 billion, which is 51% of the total. 

Nielsen is discovering there are younger generations that are Not Averse to Ads. In addition to being able to reach consumers in different viewing environments, 
given the affinity for video on-the-go, advertisers should also consider that some consumers seem to be open to ads, especially if there is a benefit. 
75% of millennials are not bothered by ads, as long as the content is free (according to the Millennials on Millennials report).  	

There is no question that consumers are increasing the amount of time they spend consuming digital media, while advertisers are increasing their ad budgets into 
digital channels. To reach a consumer or user you have to react quicker and more efficiently and luckily technology can help with that too. 
Marketing automation is crucial at this stage.

**Ad Tech** (short for advertising technology) is the term for the software and tools that help agencies and brands create, target, deliver, and analyze their digital 
advertising efforts. That said, ad tech is designed to help advertisers make better use of their budgets.

This is where **Vidsey** comes in. We’ll help you create suitable videos for your brand quickly and efficiently. 
Just imagine you don’t need to hire a designer and wait for videos, but could be made almost instantly?  

As everybody talks about automation of jobs. I believe nobody will miss this daily grind.
